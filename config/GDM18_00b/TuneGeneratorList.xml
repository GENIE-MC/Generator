NOTE:

The GENIE authors would like to caution users against using anything but a comprehensive 
GENIE mode (`Default' setting below) for physics studies.
No detector measures generator-level reaction modes like CCQE or NCRES.
Detectors measure final states / topologies like {1mu-,0pi}, {1mu-,1pi+}, {0mu-, 1pi0}, 
{1 track, 1 shower}, {1 mu-like ring} etc depending on granularity, thresholds and PID capabilities.
No final state / topology is a proxy for any particular reaction mode.
Intranuclear re-scattering in particular causes significant migration between states
(see Table 8.1 in the Physics and User manual).

Examples:
- {1mu-,0pi} is mostly numuCCQE, but can also be caused by numu resonance production followed by pion absorption.
- numuCCQE gives mostly {1mu-,0pi} but occasionaly can give {1mu-,1pi} if the recoil nucleon re-interacts.
- NC1pi0 final states can be caused by all a) NC elastic followed by nucleon rescattering, 
  b) NC resonance neutrino-production, c) NC non-resonance background, d) low-W NC DIS
  e) NC coherent scattering. Each source contributes differently in the pion momentum distribution.

We also recommend that you treat the generator-level reaction modes largely as as an internal degree of freedom. 
Consequently, try to define your selection efficiencies and purities in terms of observable final states _only_.
For example, if you define as `numuCCQE-like' := {1mu-,0pi} then define your selection efficiency
as:
  efficiency = (`numuCCQE-like' events passing cuts) / (all true {1mu-,0pi} events)
and not as: 
  efficiency = (`numuCCQE-like' events passing cuts) / (all true numuCCQE events)
